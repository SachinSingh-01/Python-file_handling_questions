File Handling Practice

## 📌 Objective
To understand how Python interacts with files and manages persistent data.

## 🧠 How I Practice

1. I begin with file modes:
   - `r` (read)
   - `w` (write)
   - `a` (append)
2. Then I practice:
   - Reading entire file
   - Reading line by line
   - Writing structured data
3. After that, I work on:
   - Exception handling with files
   - Using `with` statement
4. Finally, I build small real-world projects:
   - Student record system
   - To-do list manager
   - Simple log system

## 🎯 What I Focus On

- Closing files properly
- Preventing data loss
- Understanding file modes clearly
- Writing clean and structured content
